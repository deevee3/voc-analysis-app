# Product Requirements Document: Voice of Customer Analysis Application

## 1. Introduction/Overview

This document outlines the requirements for building a comprehensive Voice of Customer (VoC) Analysis Application that collects, processes, and analyzes customer feedback from multiple online sources. The application will help Customer Success teams identify pain points, track satisfaction trends, and derive actionable insights from diverse customer conversations across the internet.

**Problem Statement:** Customer Success teams struggle to aggregate and analyze customer feedback scattered across forums, social media, review sites, and other platforms. Manual monitoring is time-consuming, inconsistent, and fails to capture the full picture of customer sentiment and recurring issues.

**Solution:** An intelligent data collection and analysis system powered by Crawl4AI that automatically scrapes, processes, and visualizes customer feedback with AI-driven sentiment analysis and theme extraction.

## 2. Goals

1. **Automated Multi-Source Data Collection:** Collect customer feedback from 10+ different platforms including Reddit, Twitter, review sites, YouTube, forums, and social media without manual intervention.

2. **Intelligent Insight Extraction:** Use GPT-4 to extract and categorize pain points, feature requests, sentiment, and actionable insights from raw customer conversations with 80%+ accuracy.

3. **Real-Time Monitoring & Alerts:** Enable proactive customer success by detecting sentiment shifts, emerging issues, and viral feedback within hours of posting.

4. **Actionable Analytics:** Provide clear visualizations and reports that enable Customer Success teams to prioritize issues, track satisfaction trends, and measure resolution impact.

5. **Scalable & Maintainable:** Build a robust system that can process 1000+ data points daily while respecting ethical scraping practices and platform guidelines.

## 3. User Stories

### Primary User: Customer Success Manager

**US-1:** As a Customer Success Manager, I want to see a dashboard of top customer pain points this week so that I can prioritize support resources effectively.

**US-2:** As a Customer Success Manager, I want to receive alerts when sentiment drops suddenly so that I can investigate and address issues before they escalate.

**US-3:** As a Customer Success Manager, I want to track how customer satisfaction around a specific feature changes over time so that I can measure the impact of improvements.

**US-4:** As a Customer Success Manager, I want to filter feedback by platform, date range, and topic so that I can analyze specific customer segments.

**US-5:** As a Customer Success Manager, I want to export insights to CSV or integrate with our CRM so that I can share findings with the broader team.

### Secondary Users

**US-6:** As a Product Manager, I want to see ranked feature requests from customers so that I can prioritize our roadmap based on real demand.

**US-7:** As an Executive, I want a quarterly sentiment summary showing trends and key themes so that I can understand overall customer health.

**US-8:** As a Support Team Lead, I want to identify emerging issues early so that I can prepare the team and create documentation proactively.

## 6. Design Considerations

### 6.1 Architecture Approach

**Modern, Modular Architecture:**
- **Backend:** Python-based with FastAPI for RESTful API
- **Frontend:** React with TypeScript for type safety and modern UI
- **Styling:** TailwindCSS for rapid, responsive design
- **Components:** shadcn/ui for consistent, accessible UI components
- **Icons:** Lucide React for clean, modern iconography
- **Charts:** Recharts or Chart.js for interactive visualizations
- **Database:** SQLite with SQLAlchemy ORM for portability and simplicity

### 6.2 User Interface Guidelines

**Dashboard Layout:**
- Clean, data-focused design with emphasis on insights
- Card-based layout for different metrics
- Responsive design for desktop, tablet, and mobile
- Dark mode support for extended use
- Keyboard shortcuts for power users

**Color System:**
- Sentiment-based color coding (red=negative, yellow=neutral, green=positive)
- Consistent color palette for themes and categories
- Accessibility compliance (WCAG 2.1 Level AA)

### 6.3 Performance Considerations

- Lazy loading for large datasets
- Pagination for insight lists (50 items per page)
- Dashboard loads in <3 seconds
- Real-time updates via WebSocket for alerts
- Background processing for heavy computations

## 7. Technical Considerations

### 7.1 Core Technologies

**Required Stack:**

## 8. Success Metrics

**Operational Metrics:**
- ✅ Successfully scrape 1000+ data points per day across all sources
- ✅ Maintain 95%+ uptime for crawling service
- ✅ Process and categorize feedback with 80%+ accuracy (measured by sample review)
- ✅ Detect sentiment with 75%+ accuracy compared to human labeling
- ✅ Dashboard loads insights in under 3 seconds
- ✅ Zero data breaches or privacy violations

**Business Metrics:**
- ✅ Customer Success teams identify issues 50% faster than manual monitoring
- ✅ 80% of alerts result in actionable team response
- ✅ Users report insights as "valuable" or "highly valuable" in 70%+ of cases
- ✅ System identifies 5+ emerging issues per month before escalation

**Technical Metrics:**
- ✅ API response time <500ms for 95th percentile
- ✅ <1% crawl failure rate (excluding legitimate blocks)
- ✅ Database queries complete in <100ms average
- ✅ System handles 10 concurrent users without degradation

## 9. Open Questions

**Q1:** Should the system support user authentication from day one, or start as a single-user application?
- **Decision:** Deferred to implementation phase. Start with basic API key auth, expand if multi-user need emerges.

**Q2:** What's the priority order for implementing different data sources?
- **Recommendation:** Phase implementation - Reddit & Twitter first (high volume, good APIs), then review sites, then forums/YouTube.

**Q3:** How should we handle platform API changes or rate limits?
- **Approach:** Implement graceful degradation and fallback to direct scraping where APIs fail. Log all failures for manual review.

**Q4:** Should historical data be backfilled or only collect going forward?
- **Decision:** Start fresh with real-time collection. Optionally provide manual backfill tool for specific high-value historical analysis.

**Q5:** How often should the LLM analysis run - real-time or batch?
- **Recommendation:** Hybrid approach - batch process every 6 hours for cost efficiency, with real-time option for urgent keywords.

**Q6:** Should we support custom LLM prompts for different industries?
- **Decision:** Start with general-purpose prompts, add customization in phase 2 if clear need emerges.

**Q7:** What level of PII anonymization is required?
- **Approach:** Store original usernames/handles but hash them in exports. Implement configurable anonymization policies per customer requirements.
