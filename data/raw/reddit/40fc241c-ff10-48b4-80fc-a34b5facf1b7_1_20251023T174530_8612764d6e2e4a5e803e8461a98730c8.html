Please do not submit the following: i) Submissions violating the guidelines. ii) Images, audio or videos: Articles with supporting image and video content are allowed; if the text is only there to explain the media, then it is not suitable.

Facebook, BlueSky, Instagram, Threads, etc). Tweets should not be used as a news source unless an official announcement by a verified company or spokesperson. 2.
